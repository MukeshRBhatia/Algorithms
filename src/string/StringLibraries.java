	//Sliding Window Technique: This technique involves using a window of a fixed size to slide through a string and perform operations on the substrings within the window. This technique is useful for problems that involve finding sub-strings or subranges in a string.

    // Two-Pointer Technique: This technique involves using two pointers, one starting from the beginning of the string and the other starting from the end. This technique is useful for problems that require searching or comparing elements in a string.

    // Regular Expressions: Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching in strings. They can be used to match specific patterns or substrings in a string, such as email addresses or phone numbers.

	// Hashing Technique: This technique involves using a hash table or a hash set to store and lookup elements in a string. This technique is useful for problems that involve finding or comparing elements in a string.

	// Dynamic Programming Technique: This technique involves breaking a problem down into smaller subproblems and solving them in a bottom-up manner. This technique is useful for problems that involve finding the optimal solution to a problem by solving smaller subproblems.

	// Trie Data Structure: Tries are an efficient data structure for storing and searching strings. They can be used to efficiently search for words or substrings in a large text corpus.

	// Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm: The KMP algorithm is a string matching algorithm that efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern in a text string. It works by preprocessing the pattern to determine the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix of each substring of the pattern.
